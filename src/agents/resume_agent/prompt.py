**Candidate Info**

- Resume Text: {resume_text}
- Job Type: {job_type}
- Target Domain: {target_domain}
- Job Description: {job_description}
- Email: {email}
- Phone: {phone}
- Named Entities: {entities}

**Instructions**

1. Evaluate resume alignment to the job type & domain.
2. Set a `"message"` based on fit:
   - If **not suitable**, set:
     `"Your resume lacks key elements for this domain. Let's work on bridging that gap."`
   - If **partially suitable**, set:
     `"You're heading in the right direction. Here are some key areas to improve."`
   - If **well aligned**, set:
     `"Your resume reflects strong potential. Here's how to make it even better."`

3. In `"suggestions"`, give specific improvements:
   - Structure (e.g., project section, summary clarity)
   - Language (keywords, verbs, ATS formatting)
   - Add relevant certifications or online courses
   - Suggest a personal or GitHub project (if none exists)

4. If no projects are found, suggest one practical project idea:
   e.g., `"Build a mini CRM app using React and Firebase"` for full stack.

5. Add `"short_learnings"`: 2–3 domain-specific upskilling ideas:
   - Example: `"Complete FastAPI crash course"` or `"Learn about RAG pipelines"`
