You will find that, although the text follows \\na plot, the topics are covered in a largely independent manner that allows you \\nto pick and choose as you desire. The book is designed to be used as a course \\nresource—not as a course definition. We suggest encouraging students to read \\nthe material not explicitly included in your course. We underrate students if we \\nassume that we have to explain everything in class. We should be helping them \\nlearn to learn on their own.\\nWe feel obliged to say a few words about the bottom-up, concrete-to-abstract \\norganization of the text.

As academics, we too often assume that students will \\nappreciate our perspective of a subject—often one that we have developed over \\nmany years of working in a field. As teachers, we think we do better by present-\\ning material from the student’s perspective. This is why the text starts with data \\nrepresentation/storage, machine architecture, operating systems, and network -\\ning. These are topics to which students readily relate—they have most likely \\nheard terms such as JPEG and MP3; they have probably recorded data on CDs \\nand DVDs; they have purchased computer components; they have interacted \\nwith an operating system; and they have used the Internet. By starting the course \\nwith these topics, students discover answers to many of the “why” questions they \\nhave been carrying for years and learn to view the course as practical rather than \\ntheoretical.

As already stated, the topics are \\npresented in a manner that does not force you to follow this bottom-up sequence, \\nbut we encourage you to give it a try.\\nWe are all aware that students learn a lot more than we teach them directly, \\nand the lessons they learn implicitly are often better absorbed than those that \\nare studied explicitly. This is significant when it comes to “teaching” problem \\nsolving. Students do not become problem solvers by studying problem-solving \\nmethodologies.

But, we believe that if a topic is relevant, then it is rel -\\nevant even if the academic community considers it to be an “advanced topic.” \\nYou deserve a text that presents a complete picture of computer science—not \\na watered-down version containing artificially simplified presentations of only \\nthose topics that have been deemed appropriate for introductory students. Thus, \\nwe have not avoided topics. Instead, we’ve sought better explanations. We’ve \\ntried to provide enough depth to give you an honest picture of what computer \\nscience is all about.

Informally, an algorithm is a set of steps that defines how a task is \\nperformed. (We will be more precise later in Chapter\\xa05.) For example, there are \\nalgorithms for cooking (called recipes), for finding your way through a strange \\ncity (more commonly called directions), for operating washing machines (usually \\ndisplayed on the inside of the washer’s lid or perhaps on the wall of a laundro -\\nmat), for playing music (expressed in the form of sheet music), and for perform-\\ning magic tricks (Figure\\xa00.1).\\nBefore a machine such as a computer can perform a task, an algorithm for'),\n",

For the convenience of machines, programs are \\nencoded in a manner compatible with the technology of the machine.

After all, intuition says that we cannot correct \\nerrors in a received message unless we already know the information in the \\nmessage. However, a simple code with such a corrective property is presented \\nin Figure\\xa01.27.\\nTo understand how this code works, we first define the term Hamming \\ndistance, which is named after R. W. Hamming, who pioneered the search for \\nerror-correcting codes after becoming frustrated with the lack of reliability of \\nthe early relay machines of the 1940s. The Hamming distance between two bit \\npatterns is the number of bits in which the patterns differ.

For now, we note that there seems to be a common thread \\nrunning through these techniques, which simply stated is “get your foot in the \\ndoor.” As an example, let us consider the following simple problem:\\nBefore A, B, C, and D ran a race they made the following predictions:\\nA predicted that B would win.\\nB predicted that D would be last.\\nC predicted that A would be third.\\nD predicted that A’s prediction would be correct.'),\n",
