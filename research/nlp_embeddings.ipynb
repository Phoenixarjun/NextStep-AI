This survey approach is, in fact, the \\nmodel used for introductory courses in the natural sciences.\\nThis broad background is also what students from other disciplines need if \\nthey are to relate to the technical society in which they live.

There is, of course, a proper place \\nfor that training, but this text is about educating.\\nWhile writing previous editions of this text, maintaining accessibility for non-\\ntechnical students was a major goal. The result was that the book has been used \\nsuccessfully in courses for students over a wide range of disciplines and educa -\\ntional levels, ranging from high school to graduate courses.

Informally, an algorithm is a set of steps that defines how a task is \\nperformed. (We will be more precise later in Chapter\\xa05.) For example, there are \\nalgorithms for cooking (called recipes), for finding your way through a strange \\ncity (more commonly called directions), for operating washing machines (usually \\ndisplayed on the inside of the washer‚Äôs lid or perhaps on the wall of a laundro -\\nmat), for playing music (expressed in the form of sheet music), and for perform-\\ning magic tricks (Figure\\xa00.1).\\nBefore a machine such as a computer can perform a task, an algorithm for'),\n",

A representation of an algorithm is called a program. For \\nthe convenience of humans, computer programs are usually printed on paper or \\ndisplayed on computer screens. For the convenience of machines, programs are \\nencoded in a manner compatible with the technology of the machine. The process \\nof developing a program, encoding it in machine-compatible form, and inserting \\nit into a machine is called programming.

Thus, \\nwe have not avoided topics. Instead, we‚Äôve sought better explanations. We‚Äôve \\ntried to provide enough depth to give you an honest picture of what computer \\nscience is all about.

Informally, an algorithm is a set of steps that defines how a task is \\nperformed. (We will be more precise later in Chapter\\xa05.) For example, there are \\nalgorithms for cooking (called recipes), for finding your way through a strange \\ncity (more commonly called directions), for operating washing machines (usually \\ndisplayed on the inside of the washer‚Äôs lid or perhaps on the wall of a laundro -\\nmat), for playing music (expressed in the form of sheet music), and for perform-\\ning magic tricks (Figure\\xa00.1).\\nBefore a machine such as a computer can perform a task, an algorithm for'),\n",

For the convenience of machines, programs are \\nencoded in a manner compatible with the technology of the machine.

With these systems, the shapes can \\nbe easily resized, maintaining a crisp display at any dimension.\\nRepresenting Sound\\nThe most generic method of encoding audio information for computer storage \\nand manipulation is to sample the amplitude of the sound wave at regular inter-\\nvals and record the series of values obtained. For instance, the series 0, 1.5, 2.0, \\n1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.0, 0 would represent a sound wave that rises in amplitude, \\nfalls briefly, rises to a higher level, and then drops back to 0 (Figure\\xa01.12). This \\ntechnique, using a sample rate of 8000 samples per second, has been used for \\nyears in long-distance voice telephone communication. The voice at one end of \\nthe communication is encoded as numeric values representing the amplitude \\nof the voice every eight-thousandth of a second. These numeric values are then'),\n",

For example, one might guess that an Internet radio station could merely \\nestablish a server that would send program messages to each of the clients who \\nrequested them. This technique is known as N-unicast. (More precisely, unicast \\nrefers to one sender sending messages to one receiver, whereas N-unicast refers \\nto a single sender involved with multiple unicasts.) The N-unicast approach has \\nbeen applied but has the drawback of placing a substantial burden on the station‚Äôs \\nserver as well as on the server‚Äôs immediate Internet neighbors. Indeed, N-unicast \\nforces the server to send individual messages to each of its clients on a real-time \\nbasis, and all these messages must be forwarded by the server‚Äôs neighbors.\\nMost alternatives to N-unicast represent attempts to alleviate this problem.'),\n",
